    <p>
        As stated our Initiative focuses on helping, the environment, whether it be sea or air pollution etc. We are an independent NGO but not yet recognised internationally. We still do have alot, important goals to catch up on and achieve in the near future, but with your help we'll be able to achieve them quicker, together. We aren't permantly stationed anywhere, but we do have multiple vechiles that do move around alot and you'll be able to find them on our website.
